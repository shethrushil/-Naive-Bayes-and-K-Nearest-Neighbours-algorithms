# Naive-Bayes-and-K-Nearest-Neighbours-algorithms

Supervised Learning - Classification
Implement the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments, x_train (the features) and y_train (the output).

The code must be uploaded to the portal and GitHub and be in Python Notebook format (.ipynb file).

The Python version to be used must be above 3.5.
